> design your react components on an infinite paper

**NOTA BENE** This project is still at an embryonic stage, I got a first prototype and I am so excited that I want to publish to get feedbacks as soon as possible. In this demo you have an iframe inside an infinite paper where you can zoom and translate: https://g14n.info/react-design

## [Features](https://github.com/fibo/react-design/projects/1)

## Motivation

Tools like Sketch, Figma and Framer give you an infinite paper where you can draw your ideas.
On the other hand it is hard to fill the gap between design and code development.
**Why?**
'Cause developers, as well as designers, want to use the tools they like, the tools they feel more confident with.
As a React developer I think Framer goes in the right direction but I feel there is still something missing.

> I want to use my development tools and environment.
> I want a design tool that is as much flexible as possible.

Furthermore, having an infinite paper can be used also for tasks other than design and prototyping. Think about documenting a website sitemap, for example.
